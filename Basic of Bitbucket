1. Create a Bitbucket Account:

If you don't have a Bitbucket account, go to https://bitbucket.org/ and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a New Repository:

    Log in to your Bitbucket account.
    Click on the "+" icon in the left sidebar and select "Repository" to create a new repository.
    Follow the prompts to set up your new repository.

3. Clone the Repository:

Clone your newly created repository to your local machine using the following command. Replace repository_url with the actual URL of your Bitbucket repository.

bash

git clone repository_url

4. Configure Git:

Set up your Git configuration if you haven't done so already. Open your terminal and run:

bash

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

5. Add Files and Commit Changes:

Navigate to your project directory and start adding files to your repository.

bash

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

6. Create and Switch Branches:

Create a new branch to work on a specific feature or bug fix:

bash

git branch branch_name
git checkout branch_name

Or use the shorthand:

bash

git checkout -b branch_name

7. Push Changes to Bitbucket:

Push your changes to the Bitbucket repository:

bash

git push origin branch_name

8. Pull Changes:

Pull changes from Bitbucket to your local repository:

bash

git pull origin branch_name

9. Merge Changes:

Merge changes from one branch to another:

bash

# Switch to the branch where you want to merge changes
git checkout target_branch

# Merge changes from the source branch
git merge source_branch

10. Forking and Pull Requests:

If you are working on a project owned by someone else, you may need to fork their repository and create pull requests to contribute changes.

    Fork a repository on Bitbucket.
    Clone your forked repository locally.
    Make changes, commit, and push to your fork.
    Create a pull request on Bitbucket to submit your changes to the original repository.
