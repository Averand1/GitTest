Git basics

Git is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.
Unlike older centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of their code repository locally. 
This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent operations such as commit, blame, diff, merge, and log dramatically faster.
Git also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools. 
Pull requests are one such popular tool that allows teams to collaborate on Git branches and efficiently review each other's code.
Git and BitBucket are same but it's working,GUI, system interface are make different.
